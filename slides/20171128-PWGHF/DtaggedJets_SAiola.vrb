\frametitle{Conclusions: \pp \ collisions at $\s =7$~TeV / 2}
\begin{easylist}[itemize]
@ Paper proposal: ``Measurement of the \pt-differential cross-section and fragmentation function of \Dzero-tagged charged jets in \pp\ collisions at $\s=7$~TeV with ALICE''
@ Preference for two separate papers dedicated for \pp\ and \pPb\
@@ The \pp\ measurement has a strong physics case by itself and a different message
@@ Different timelines
@@ Different collision energy
@@ Potentially different audience (HEP community probably more interested in \pp)
\end{easylist}
