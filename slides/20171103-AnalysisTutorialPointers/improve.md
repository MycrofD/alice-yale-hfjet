# Proposals for improvements

Note: `&` is pronounced "ampersand"; ` *` is pronounced "star"

* Do an introduction about C++11: `auto`
* Slide 5: define first the operator `&`
* Slide 8: some words about arrays in C/C++ before this slide; define `FilterTracks` in this slide
* Slide 9: define `FilterTracks` and `AnalyzeTracks` in the same slide
* Slide 12: note - cannot assign the value of a unique_ptr to a raw pointer or to any other type of pointer!
* Show some real use case of `unique_ptr` (e.g. factory or even better an example from AliRoot/AliPhysics)
* Slide 15: re-do teh graphic adding the example of a multiply-owned object
* Clarify where and how to use smart pointers in ALICE software (and where it is not possible and raw pointers must be used)
