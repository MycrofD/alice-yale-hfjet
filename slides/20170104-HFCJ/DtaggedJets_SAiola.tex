% Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure
% may not be suitable. Here are some rules that apply for this
% solution: 

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

% - A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you
%   are going to talk about. So *simplify*!
% - In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard
%   enough. Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than
%   you think necessary.
% - If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation,
%   just say so once. Everybody will be happy with that.

\item Extract an absolute uncertainty for each of the 3 variations ($m_{\rm b}$, PDF, $\mu_{\rm F}$/$\mu_{\rm R}$) by picking the most extreme
\item Since the FD spectrum is subtracted from the measured spectrum the absolute uncertainties are summed in quadrature

\section{Raw Yield Extraction}

\section{Summary \& Outlook}

\begin{frame}{Comments from Jeremy}

{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{ForestGreen}{P.5: The branching ratio for D0 -> K$\pi$ is listed as 3.89\% - note that as of the 2016 update (Chin. Phys. C, 40, 100001 (2016)) this value has been updated to $3.93\pm0.04$\% - it's a small change, but this should probably be accounted for in the results (DONE)}

\item \textcolor{BrickRed}{P.12: In the sig. extraction method comparison for pp, the results indeed agree within statistical uncertainties, but is it understood why the ratio systematically falls with increasing pT?} \textcolor{NavyBlue}{Similar question in p-Pb for the bins at 12-16 and 16-24 GeV - the ratio plot  seems to be missing in this case, but by eye on the plot it looks like 25 \& 30\% for those two bins (I assume that the larger difference at high pT in fig. 23 is more due to the different pT cut and doesn't affect the analysis too much).  (\pPb, Barbara)} \textcolor{BrickRed}{Is there somehow any difference in how the efficiency correction affects the two methods, or is this already seen in the raw yields?}

\item \textcolor{NavyBlue}{P.14: ''the more sparse environment compared to Pb-Pb'' ? is Pb-Pb relevant here? It would seem to me to make more sense to justify this with respect to pp instead. (\pPb, Barbara)}
\end{itemize}
}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Comments from Jeremy (cont'd)}

{\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Figs. 16\&17: The caption says that it is in bins of D-meson transverse momentum while the label says pT,jet ? I guess both should be jet pT instead? (DONE)}

\item \textcolor{BrickRed}{P.23: The current discussion on the unfolding uncertainty ? for pp I mostly agree, except perhaps the bin at 10-14 and 20-30 GeV/c ? if you are considering a systematic with respect to SVD, the 10\% is smaller than the statistical uncertainty, yes, but I would not say it is negligible (and similar goes for the $\sim$70\% at 20-30)}. \textcolor{NavyBlue}{A similar plot for p-Pb seems to be missing right now, and might be useful to see what differences (if any) there are there. (\pPb, Barbara)}

\item \textcolor{BrickRed}{P.24: Results - I must admit, I'm not entirely sure at first glance what we learn from taking the ratio of one species in pp to the other species in p-Pb?}

\item \textcolor{BrickRed}{Which figures are being aimed for the preliminary?}

            \item Cut variations?
