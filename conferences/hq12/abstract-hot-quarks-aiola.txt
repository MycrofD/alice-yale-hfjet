Reconstruction of jets in high-energy heavy-ion collisions is challenging due to the fluctuations in the background induced by soft particles. Signal jets, which come from hard scattered partons, are reconstructed using the anti-$k_{T}$ jet finder algorithm. The average background is calculated on an event-by-event basis and then subtracted on a jet-by-jet basis to reduce the contribution to the jet reconstructed energy coming from the underlying event. The resulting jet spectrum is corrected to account for fluctuations in the average energy density and detector effects by unfolding the result on a statistical basis. Different data driven approaches to deal with the combinatorial background are presented. Detector-specific induced effects are studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations and discussed as well. The presented results come from data collected in 2011 by the ALICE detetcor at LHC for PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=2.76 TeV, and makes use of the tracking system and the electromagnetic calorimeter to reconstruct both charged and neutral particles.
